# A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.

# your models are essentially your database layout, with additional metadata

# Post model -- inherits from django Model class

    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
